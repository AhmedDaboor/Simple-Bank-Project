# Simple Bank Project  

This project is an educational experiment to apply programming concepts using C++.  
It simulates a simple banking system with the following features:  

- Account Management: Create, update, and manage user accounts.  
- Transaction Logging: Record deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations.  
- File-Based Data Storage: Store and retrieve account and transaction data using text files.  

The project was developed as part of my learning journey in C++, focusing on:  

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
- File handling for persistent data storage.  
- Basic algorithms and data structures relevant to banking operations.  

This project is not intended for actual use but rather for exploring programming concepts and applying them in a practical scenario.
